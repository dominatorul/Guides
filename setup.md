### üé¨ Before You Start

üõ† **Install the Latest Versions** of Atmosphere and Hekate:

To simplify the process, you can follow this [guide](https://switchway.net/update-atmosphere). It includes a pre-configured `hekate_ipl.ini` file, which will make the setup easier.

If you prefer to update manually proceed here:
- **[Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases/)**: Download the latest version of the custom firmware.

üõ† **Back Up eMMC(SYSNAND) using Hekate**

1. Open `Hekate` and navigate to the `Tools` section, then select `Backup eMMC`.
2. Create a backup of `eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1`.
3. Back up the `eMMC RAW GPP` partition.

üõ† **Back Up emuMMC(EMUNAND) using Hekate**

1. Open `Hekate` and navigate to the `Tools` section, then select `Backup eMMC`.
2. To back up `emuMMC`, enable the option for `SD emuMMC Raw Partition` .
3. Create a backup of `SD emuMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1`.
4. Back up the `SD emuMMC RAW GPP` partition.

A `backup` folder will now be created in the root of your SD card. Copy the folder to your PC for safekeeping, then delete it from the root of your microSD card to free up space. Be sure to store the folder safely.

!!!note Remember to [**fix the archive bit**](#fixing-archive-bit) after using UMS.

### üíæ Installation

**Automatic Installation**
I've created this [tool](https://github.com/dominatorul/Easy-Setup/releases/tag/Latest) to simplify the installation process. It's still a work in progress, but it functions well.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è I recommend backing up and removing your old `atmosphere/contents` folder before proceeding.

**Manual Installation**
If you prefer to understand what's included and how to install everything manually, continue here:



1. **SaltyNX**
   - üì• Download from [this link](https://github.com/masagrator/SaltyNX/releases/latest).

   - Open the `system_settings.ini` file and paste this at the bottom of all the text:

```ini
[atmosphere]
; Controls whether dmnt cheats should be toggled on or off by

### üõ† Fixing Archive Bit

After booting `Hekate`, navigate to **Tools** > **Arch Bit ‚Ä¢ RCM ‚Ä¢ Touch ‚Ä¢ pkg1/2** > **Fix Archive Bit**. This ensures the files can be read properly.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up the KIP

0. **Check Console Info**
   - Boot into Hekate, and go to Console Info - HW & Fuses. Record the **DRAM ID, CPU Speedo 0, CPU Speedo 2,** and **SoC Speedo.**

1. **Launch CFW**
   - Launch the custom firmware (CFW) on your console.

2. **Accessing Overlays:**
    - Press `ZL`, `ZR`, and `DPAD DOWN` simultaneously to access overlays. If that doesn't work, try `L`, `D-pad down` and `R-stick`.
    - To edit the key combination in `Ultrahand`, press `+` then navigate into `Key Combo` menu. I personally use `L`, `R`, and `DPAD UP`.

3. **Open OC Switchcraft EOS Overlay:**
	- Open `Ultrahand`
	- Press `D-pad right` and click on `OC Switchcraft EOS`
- In case this doesn't appear, fix [archive bit](#fixing-archive-bit)

4. **Adjust KIP Settings**
   - Use the appropriate settings based on your console configuration:
     - [Mariko (Oled, Lite, V2) Guide](https://rentry.co/mariko)
     - [Erista (V1) Guide](https://rentry.co/erista)

!!!note Restart your console after changing KIP settings to apply them.

!!!danger If you notice RAM artifacts, hold down the power button to shut down and prevent corruption, then reduce some timings.

Check your settings‚Äô stability here: [How to test stability](https://rentry.co/howtoteststability)

### üöÄ Enabling Overclock with sys-clk
- Open `Ultrahand` and select `sys-clk`.
- Enable `sys-clk` and adjust the settings by pressing on `Edit app profile` or `Edit global profile` for desired performance.
- It's recommended to set the maximum RAM setting in the global profile override for significant performance gains without substantial power draw. Ensure to test RAM stability first (refer to the settings guide for instructions).

Miscellaneous Settings:
- `Uncapped Clocks`: Removes clock cappings	. Turn this ON.
- `Override Boost Mode`: Overrides official boost mode with user set profile clocks. Turn this OFF.
- `Auto CPU Boost`: Sets the CPU clock to boost frequency when any one of the cores is at ‚â• 90% load. Turn this OFF.
- `Sync ReverseNX`: Overrides profile to match reversenx state. Turn this OFF.
- `Gpu DVFS`: Gpu vmin is auto raised and reverted on emc(RAM) clock change (mariko only). Turn this ON.

### üîì Unlocking 60 FPS with FPSLocker

- Launch a game and open `Ultrahand`. Select `FPSLocker`.
- Click the `Increase FPS target` button six times. The custom FPS target should be set to 60.
- If the FPS does not increase past 30, the game may require a patch:
   - Open `Ultrahand`, click on `FPSLocker`, then go to `Advanced Settings`.
   - Select `Check/download config file`, wait for it to complete, then choose `Convert config to patch`.
   - Restart the game and set the FPS target to 60 in `FPSLocker`.
- If a patch isn't available:
   - Open `Ultrahand`, click on `FPSLocker`, then go to `Advanced Settings`.
   - Select `Window Sync` and set it to `semi`.
Visit the [FPSLocker Warehouse](https://github.com/masagrator/FPSLocker-Warehouse) to download patches for games needing further tweaks.

!!!note Some games may require 60 FPS mods or cheats in addition to FPSLocker.

---

### üí° Using ReverseNX-RT

1. Launch a game and open `Ultrahand`. Select `ReverseNX-RT`.
2. Press the `Change System Control` button so the mode won't be controlled by the system anymore.
3. Press the `Change Mode` button to set it to the desired mode.

!!!danger **Warning:** Never use docked mode when unplugged if `Sync ReverseNX` is enabled in sys-clk. This will set the clocks to docked mode and may damage the battery.

---

### üìä Monitoring FPS with Status Monitor

1. Launch a game and open `Ultrahand`. Select `Status Monitor`.
2. Choose a mode to check FPS, temperature, voltage, usage, etc. It's recommended to use `Mini` or `Micro mode`.
3. To exit the overlay, hold your `Ultrahand` key combo for 3 seconds.

---

### üéö Using EdiZon

0. Download cheats. Launch `All-in-One Switch Updater` from the `hbmenu`. Move to `Download cheats` on the left panel, then select `Download GBAtemp.net cheat archive (ver xxxxxxxx)` from the right panel (this will only download cheats for the titles you have installed. If you want to download all available cheats you can select `Download GBAtemp.net cheat codes`).
1. Launch a game and open `Ultrahand`. Select `EdiZon`. Click on `Cheats`.
2. Enable and disable cheats by pressing A, a cheat is enabled if it says 'On'. Sometimes cheats may require turning them on and off for them to work. Ensure you disable cheats you are not using i.e. disable the 30FPS cheat if using the 60FPS cheat or disable the 720p cheat if using a 1080p cheat.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting and Further Information

- **READMEs:** Check each tool's README for in-depth guidance.
- **Community Support:** Seek help from forums and Discord for updates.

‚ùå **Console not booting?**

Update Atmosphere or set CPU UV level to 0.

### ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

#### Sys-clk Doesn‚Äôt Allow More Than 1785/921/1600
This issue usually occurs due to a bad setup of your Hekate entry lines.
- Download this [hekate_ipl](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17683638/copy_to_SD.zip).
- Open the `copy_to_SD` folder and copy the `bootloader` folder to the root of your SD card.
**Note:** This will override your current launch menu.

#### Sys-clk Displays a Different RAM Frequency Than Set in the Toolkit
This issue usually occurs because the system wasn't restarted to apply the changes.
- Restart your device.
- Open Sys-clk again and check the results.

#### My Game Runs at 2x Speed/The FPS Is Still Capped at 30 FPS
This happens when the FPS is unlocked, but the game engine isn‚Äôt designed for it. You need a patch:
- Open `Ultrahand`, click on `FPSLocker`, then go to `Advanced Settings`.
- Select `Check/Download Config File`, wait for it to complete, then choose `Convert Config to Patch`.
- Restart the game and set the FPS target to 60 in `FPSLocker`.

#### Cheats Don‚Äôt Display
Ensure your game build ID matches the cheat one. Update or downgrade your game to a compatible version.

#### FPSLocker Patch Doesn‚Äôt Show Up Even Though It‚Äôs in the Warehouse
This can occur if the patch isn‚Äôt compatible with your game version. Update or downgrade your game to a compatible version.

#### What SOC Temperatures Are Safe for the Switch When Docked Under Full Load?
Temperatures under 70¬∞C are generally safe. Mariko models are better equipped to handle heat.

#### Power Limits on the Switch
- Avoid drawing more than 8.6W in handheld mode; battery draw can be checked in the status monitor.
- Undervolt as much as possible to stay within safe limits.
