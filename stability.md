## CPU Testing

The only reliable artificial CPU stress test application is **`StressNX`**. To test your CPU:

1. Press `X` to set the test mode to `matrixpod`.
2. Press `Y` to enable **`burning`** mode.
3. Press `A` to start the test.
4. Test all frequencies for about 15-30 seconds and check if the voltage result is stable.

### Recommended Games for Testing CPU Undervolting (UV)

1. **`Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit`**
   - **Scenario:** If the CPU undervolt is unstable, the game will crash in the main menu on the map at 1963 MHz and 60 fps (credits to B3711).
   - **Testing Procedure:** Leave the game running on the desired frequency for 15-30 seconds while on the map screen. Test every frequency carefully to ensure stability.

2. **`Kirby and the Forgotten Land`**
   - **Scenario:** This game is suitable for testing low CPU Vmin using stock clock speed (1020 MHz).
   - **Testing Procedure:** Run the game docked at 60 fps to observe for crashes or instability. Let it run for hours; it may crash after prolonged testing.

## GPU Testing

Testing GPU stability using GPU voltage offsets or undervolting (UV3) can be challenging, as no reliable artificial stress tests are available on the Horizon Operating System (HOS). Therefore, we rely on games known to be sensitive to unstable GPU voltages.

### Signs of GPU Voltage Instability

- **Visual Glitches:** "Disco lights," white flashes, or color distortions indicate that the GPU voltage is too low.
- **Crashes and Hangs:** If the GPU voltage is insufficient, games might crash or hang without showing visual glitches.

### Examples of GPU Voltage Instability

1. **`Convergence: A League of Legends Story`**
   - **Very Low GPU Voltage:** Observe color distortion and blue light.
   - **Slightly Higher but Still Low GPU Voltage:** Persistent blue light.

2. **`SIFU`**
   - **Too Low GPU Voltage:** Subtle white flashes, especially on the left side of the screen.

3. **`Pikmin 3 Deluxe`**
   - **Low GPU Voltage and Vmin:** Pixel corruption in the bottom left corner of the image.

## RAM Testing

Test at maximum (safe) clocks docked to ensure maximum possible load.
If you can't dock your switch, use `ReverseNX`.

### Recommended Games for Testing RAM Stability

1. **`Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin`**
   - **Scenario:** Start the game and let the first two cutscenes run. Look for artifacts.

2. **`The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (TOTK)`**
   - **Scenario:** Run the game for about an hour; crashes, freezes, or hangs indicate unstable RAM.
   Version 1.0.0 is particularly sensitive.

3. **`Red Dead Redemption`**
   - **Scenario:** Run the game for about an hour to detect instability.

4. **`Borderlands 3`**
   - **Scenario:** Monitor for pixel corruption, crashes, or hangs after extended play.

5. **`Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel`**
   - **Scenario:** Similar to `Borderlands 3`, it stresses RAM heavily.

6. **`Nier Automata`**
   - **Scenario:** Especially effective with 60 FPS cheats or graphical mods.

7. **`Kirby and the Forgotten Land`**
   - **Scenario:** Monitor for crashes or graphical corruption after extended play.

### Example of RAM Instability

- **Game:** `Borderlands 3`
   - **Unstable RAM:** Pixel corruption or crashes during play.

## Benchmarking Ram

`MemtoolkitNX` is recommended for benchmarking ram (useful for tightening timings for instance), but may also be used for cpu and gpu.
To run it, simply start it using title override at its default settings.
!!! danger `MemtoolkitNX` is known for being unreliable for testing stability, only use it for benchmarking.

## Ultracam Benchmark Test

The **Ultracam** benchmark test is one of the best tools to assess system performance and stability under heavy load. It is highly recommended for testing RAM, GPU, and overall system stability. For details, visit this guide: [TOTK Ultracam Test and Benchmark](https://rentry.co/ultracam).
